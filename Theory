                        Solving Ax = b with LU-factorization
                        
        Suppose that we have a system of linear equations Ax = b, where A is n x n matrix. 
To solve this system, we will use LU-factorization. 

        What is LU-factorization?   
Suppose that we can write
                                      A = LU
where L is a lower triangular matrix and U is an upper triangular matrix. 
Our aim is to find L and U and once we have done so we have found an LU decomposition of A.
But this method has a few problems. One of them is that our matrix A might be singular and 
in this case, during calculation of row echelon form we may get 0 as a pivot.
This will lately result in division by zero when we will search U matrix. 

        To solve a system of linear equations Ax = b and avoid this problem we used a modified
LU-factorization method. We found a decomposition 
                                      A = PLU
where P is a permutation matrix, L is a lower-triangular matrix, and U is an upper-triangular
matrix. Now, it is possible to solve a system of equation. As PLUx = b, we can define y which
equals to Ux. So, Ly = PB, Ux = y. Thus, we can find x. 
        In the process of searching U and L matrices we used Gaussian Elimination. However, we
didn't write just a reduce_row_echelon_form function, we also wrote row_echelon_form because 
matrix U is in row echelon form and not in reduce row echelon form. 


Our pseudocode: 

For i = 1, 2, ..., n - 1 do:
        Find the row j with the largest entry in absolute value on or below the diagonal of the 
        ith row and swap rows i and j in all three matrices, PT, L, and U. If this maximum entry
        is zero, terminate this loop and indicate that the matrix is singular, that is, 
        non-invertible.
        
        For j = i + 1, ..., n, calculate the scalar value s = -uj,i / ui,i.    
        
        Add s times row i onto row j in the matrix U and set the entry lj,i = -s.
        
Having iterated from i = 1, 2, ..., n, finish by adding the identity matrix onto L = L + In. 
These are the PT, L, and U matrices of the PLU decomposition of A.
